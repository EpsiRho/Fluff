# Fluff

A beautiful, native windows app for e621!

This is a rewrite of my old client, e610.NET. It was written was I was less experienced and I made it really stupidly. I'm working to fix those old mistakes in this version! Consider this the 2.0 version that never came out for the old client.

I'm not throwing away all the code either, it'll just be brought over and fit in nicer than before. Also, because I'm being smarter this time, I have a lot planned that I couldn't add properly last time.

Lastly, Get it now on the Microsoft Store!
